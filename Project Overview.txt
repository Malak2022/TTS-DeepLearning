📖 Project Description

This project implements a deep learning Text-to-Speech (TTS) system using Tacotron 2 as the core sequence-to-sequence model. The objective is to transform raw text input into natural-sounding human speech, leveraging neural network architectures for both text-to-mel spectrogram generation and waveform synthesis.

⚙️ Model Workflow

Input: Raw text string (e.g., “Hello, how are you?”).

Preprocessing:

Convert text into a sequence of characters.

Apply text normalization and tokenization.

Encoding: Character sequences are processed with a bidirectional LSTM encoder.

Decoding with Attention:

The decoder, enhanced with an attention mechanism, predicts mel spectrograms.

Post-processing:

A convolutional postnet refines the generated spectrograms.

Waveform Reconstruction:

Initial synthesis with Griffin-Lim algorithm.

Optionally improved with neural vocoders (WaveGlow, HiFi-GAN).

Output:

Audio waveform

Visualizations (mel spectrograms, attention alignments)

📊 Training Configuration

Dataset: Preprocessed LJSpeech corpus (13,100 samples).

Loss Functions:

L1 loss on mel spectrogram predictions

Gate prediction loss for sequence termination

Optimizer: Adam with learning rate scheduling.

Monitoring:

TensorBoard dashboards for loss and alignment tracking

Checkpointing: Automatic saving of best-performing models.

🎵 Audio Generation

Mel Spectrogram Prediction → Griffin-Lim → Audio waveform

Future Improvement: Replace Griffin-Lim with HiFi-GAN vocoder for higher fidelity.

📈 Expected Outcomes

Training Duration: Several hours to days (depending on hardware resources).

Convergence Indicators:

Decreasing loss curves

Clear diagonal attention alignments

Audio Quality:

Good intelligibility

Natural prosody with sufficient training
